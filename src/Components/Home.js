          Welcome to our exploration of Venice—the legendary "Floating City."
          Famous for its enchanting canals, breathtaking architecture, and
          timeless cultural treasures, Venice has captivated travelers and
          romantics for centuries. But beneath its beauty lies a pressing
          reality: the city is sinking. Rising tides, environmental changes, and
          the pressures of modern tourism threaten its very existence. This site
          dives into why Venice is at risk and showcases the innovative
          solutions being pursued to protect it. From historic preservation to
          cutting-edge engineering, we highlight the efforts aimed at keeping
          Venice afloat—both literally and culturally—for generations to come.
          Whether you’re a history lover, a traveler, or simply curious, join us
          in discovering the story of a city unlike any other and the fight to
          save it.
