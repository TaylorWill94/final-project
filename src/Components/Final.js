        <h1>Venice is Sinking</h1>

          Venice is a beautiful city full of charm and wonder. Surrounded by
          sparkling waters, it’s often considered a lover’s dream. But beneath
          its beauty lies a serious problem — Venice is sinking. You might think
          this isn’t an issue since the city is already surrounded by water, but
          it’s a much bigger problem than it seems. Several times a year, Venice
          floods during high tides, an event known as acqua alta, or “high
          water.” Although these events aren’t unusual, the frequency and
          severity of the floods have increased over the years. As the Earth
          continues to heat up, sea levels rise even more. Venice’s sinking is
          caused by several factors, including groundwater extraction, soil
          compression from heavy buildings, natural tectonic movement, and
          repeated flooding.

          <h1>Groundwater Extraction</h1>
          <p>
            Groundwater extraction involves pumping water from underground
            reservoirs. Although this practice ended in the 1970s, removing the
            water left empty pockets in the ground. Over time, the heavy weight
            of Venice’s buildings caused the soil to sink into these spaces,
            contributing to the city’s gradual sinking.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h1>Soil Compression</h1>
          <p>
            Venice by nature is a natural marsh which means it is made up of wet
            soft and muddy oil. In order for all the beautiful buildings to be
            built, engineers dug wooden poles into the earth to act as a
            foundation. Over time buildings have pushed down on this soil
            causing it to compact and compress. This is where we get buildings
            sinking over time.

          This issue is important for making a city resilient in the future
          because as we face global warming, sinking isn't just an issue in
          Venice. Addressing how to fix this issue is important to the
          sustanability of many cities throughout the world. As well as making
          sure that there are proper protection mesasures in place. If we can
          truly find a solution to combat cities from sinking, this can reframe
          Global Warming. We can use this information and distribute it to
          cities worldwide. Currently there is a system in place which is called
          the MOSE system. This system has 78 steel elements that each weigh 250
          tons. This system is designed to protect the city of venice and the
          barriers are over 130cm over sea level. This is a system that does
          have to be physically deployed.

          The praticular population that will be effected first are the
          residents and visitors of Venice. Outside of the residents of Venice,
          any community that is on a coastline is threatneded by the issue of
          sinking.
