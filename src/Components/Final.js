        <h1>Venice is Sinking</h1>
      </div>
      <div className="first">
        <p>
          Venice is a beautiful city full of charm and wonder. Surrounded by
          sparkling waters, it’s often considered a lover’s dream. But beneath
          its beauty lies a serious problem — Venice is sinking. You might think
          this isn’t an issue since the city is already surrounded by water, but
          it’s a much bigger problem than it seems. Several times a year, Venice
          floods during high tides, an event known as acqua alta, or “high
          water.” Although these events aren’t unusual, the frequency and
          severity of the floods have increased over the years. As the Earth
          continues to heat up, sea levels rise even more. Venice’s sinking is
          caused by several factors, including groundwater extraction, soil
          compression from heavy buildings, natural tectonic movement, and
          repeated flooding.

          <h1>Groundwater Extraction</h1>
          <p>
            Groundwater extraction involves pumping water from underground
            reservoirs. Although this practice ended in the 1970s, removing the
            water left empty pockets in the ground. Over time, the heavy weight
            of Venice’s buildings caused the soil to sink into these spaces,
            contributing to the city’s gradual sinking.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h1>Soil Compression</h1>
          <p>
            Venice was built on a marshy landscape made up of soft, wet soil. To
            support the city’s beautiful buildings, engineers drove wooden poles
            deep into the ground to create a sturdy foundation. Over the
            centuries, the weight of these structures has slowly pressed down on
            the soft soil, causing it to compact and sink. This gradual settling
            is one of the main reasons Venice continues to sink today.

      <div>
        <h1>Why is this Important?</h1>
        <p>
          This issue is important for making cities more resilient in the future
          because, as global warming continues, sinking isn’t just a problem in
          Venice. Finding ways to address and prevent this issue is vital for
          the sustainability of cities around the world and for ensuring that
          proper protective measures are in place. If we can discover effective
          solutions to stop cities from sinking, it could change how we think
          about and respond to global warming. The lessons learned from Venice
          can help guide other cities facing similar challenges. One major
          effort to protect Venice is the MOSE system — a series of 78 steel
          barriers, each weighing about 250 tons. These barriers can be raised
          during high tides to shield the city from flooding, standing more than
          130 centimeters above sea level when deployed. While the system must
          be operated manually, it represents a significant step forward in
          protecting Venice from rising waters.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h1>Who is Impacted?</h1>
        <p>
          The people who will be affected first are the residents and visitors
          of Venice. For those who call the city home, the rising waters
          threaten their homes, livelihoods, and cultural heritage. Tourists,
          too, face growing risks as flooding disrupts transportation, damages
          landmarks, and affects local businesses. Beyond Venice, any community
          located along a coastline faces similar dangers. As sea levels
          continue to rise, coastal cities around the world — from Miami to
          Bangkok — are experiencing the same challenges of erosion, flooding,
          and infrastructure strain. What’s happening in Venice is a warning
          sign for what could happen elsewhere if global action isn’t taken to
          protect vulnerable regions and slow the effects of climate change.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h1>A Solution</h1>
        <p>
          One way to help combat Venice’s sinking is by strengthening the city’s
          foundation and improving how water is managed. Engineers could
          reinforce the wooden piles under the buildings or replace some with
          stronger, water-resistant materials. Upgrading the city’s drainage and
          water flow systems could also reduce the pressure on the soil beneath
          Venice. On top of that, restoring wetlands around the lagoon could
          help absorb excess water and protect the city from flooding. Combined
          with global efforts to slow climate change, these steps could give
          Venice a better chance of staying above water for generations to come.
