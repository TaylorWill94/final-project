        <h1>Venice</h1>
        <p>
          Venice is a beautiful city with amazing charm and wonder. Surronded by
          the beautiful waters, Venice is a lover's dream. But throughout its
          beauty, Venice is facing a dire problem. Venice is sinking. You may
          think that isn't an issue being that Venice is surronded by water, but
          it is more of an issue than you think. Several times a year Venice
          floods at high tide. This event is called "acqua alta" or "high
          water." Although these events aren't out of the norm, over the years
          there has been more flooding than usual. As the Earth heats up, the
          water risese more and more. The reason being that Venice is sinking is
          groundwater extraction and soil compression from heavy buldings. Also
          natural tectonic plate movement and frequent flooding.

          <h1>Groundwater Extraction</h1>
          <p>
            Groundwater Extraction is a process that involves pumping water from
            underground water resoviors. Although this process stopped in the
            1970s, when the water was removed it left empty spaces in the
            ground. This left the weight of Venice's buildings to compress the
            soil into the empty space.

          This issue is important for making a city resilient in the future
          because as we face global warming, sinking isn't just an issue in
          Venice. Addressing hoow to fix this issue is important to the
          sustanability of many cities throughout the world. As well as making
          sure that there are proper protection mesasures in place.
